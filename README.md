# Data-Visualisation

Data-Visualisation is a Python project focused on exploring, analyzing, and presenting data using interactive and static visualizations. The project demonstrates practical use of Plotly, Matplotlib, and API data fetching to convey insights from various datasets in a visually compelling way.

## Project Structure

### Plotly
This folder contains interactive visualizations built using Plotly. Examples include graphs depicting the results of dice throws and other simulated experiments. The focus is on creating dynamic, interactive charts that make data exploration intuitive.

### Matplotlib
Contains static visualizations created with Matplotlib. Here, mathematical datasets were analyzed, including simulations of random walks, to illustrate statistical and mathematical patterns through clear and informative plots.

### JSON
In this folder, data stored in JSON format was analyzed and visualized using Plotly. A notable example is the analysis of global earthquake data, visualized with `Scattergeo` and `Layout` to display magnitude, coordinates, location names, and other relevant attributes.

### CSV
This folder includes analyses of CSV-formatted data using Matplotlib. For example, weather data from Sitka, USA was explored to compare daily high and low temperatures and visualize temperature differences over time.

### API
Demonstrates how to fetch and visualize data from public APIs using Python, Plotly, and Matplotlib. Examples include:
- **GitHub API:** Displaying the most starred Python repositories and visualizing them with Matplotlib.  
- **Hacker News API:** Showing trending topics to discuss and visualizing the data for insights.
